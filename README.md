# Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me
I‚Äôm a **Software Engineer** with solid experience in **backend** development, automation, and system integrations, delivering solutions that connect business needs with high-quality, maintainable code.

My work spans from financial data processing in fintech environments to building modern web applications and APIs that integrate multiple systems. I combine strong problem-solving skills with a clean-code mindset, applying Clean Architecture and scalable design patterns in my projects.

Core expertise:

- **Backend Development:** Python (FastAPI, Django, Flask, Pandas, SQLAlchemy), Clojure and Javascript (Node.js) building scalable APIs and microservices.
- **Frontend Development:** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) for dynamic interfaces, with experience in Next.js and Chakra UI.
- **Automation & Data Processing:** Python (Pandas, Selenium, SMTP) and RPA (UI Path) to optimize workflows and reduce manual work.
- **System Integrations:** Designing API-driven solutions and integrating legacy systems, databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite) and external services.
- **Software Architecture:** Applying Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, and best practices for maintainability and scalability.
- **DevOps & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Docker, and deployment to Vercel, Render, and Google Cloud Run.

With a background in Electrical Engineering and experience in fintechs like Nubank, I bridge technical depth with business awareness, creating software that is not only functional but strategic.
